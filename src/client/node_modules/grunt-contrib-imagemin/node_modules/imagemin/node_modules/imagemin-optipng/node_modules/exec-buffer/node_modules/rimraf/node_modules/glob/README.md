# Glob

Match files using the patterns the shell uses, like stars and stuff.

This is a glob implementation in JavaScript.  It uses the `minimatch`
library to do its matching.

## Usage

```javascript
var glob = require("glob")

// options is optional
glob("**/*.js", options, function (er, files) {
  // files is an array of filenames.
  // If the `nonull` option is set, and nothing
  // was found, then files is ["**/*.js"]
  // er is an error object or null.
})
```

## Glob Primer

"Globs" are the patterns you type when you do stuff like `ls *.js` on
the command line, or put `build/*` in a `.gitignore` file.

Before parsing the path part patterns, braced sections are expanded
into a set.  Braced sections start with `{` and end with `}`, with any
number of comma-delimited sections within.  Braced sections may contain
slash characters, so `a{/b/c,bcd}` would expand into `a/b/c` and `abcd`.

The following characters have special magic meaning when used in a
path portion:

* `*` Matches 0 or more characters in a single path portion
* `?` Matches 1 character
* `[...]` Matches a range of characters, similar to a RegExp range.
  If the first character of the range is `!` or `^` then it matches
  any character not in the range.
* `!(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches anything that does not match
  any of the patterns provided.
* `?(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches zero or one occurrence of the
  patterns provided.
* `+(pattern|pattern|pattern)` Matches one or more occurrences of the
  patterns provided.
* `*(a|b|c)` Matches zero or more occurrences of the patterns provided
* `@(pattern|pat*|pat?erN)` Matches exactly one of the patterns
  provided
* `**` If a "globstar" is alone in a path portion, then it matches
  zero or more directories and subdirectories searching for matches.
  It does not crawl symlinked directories.

### Dots

If a file or directory path portion has a `.` as the first character,
then it will not match any glob pattern unless that pattern's
corresponding path part also has a `.` as its first character.

For example, the pattern `a/.*/c` would match the file at `a/.b/c`.
However the pattern `a/*/c` would not, because `*` does not start with
a dot character.

You can make glob treat dots as normal characters by setting
`dot:true` in the options.

### Basename Matching

If you set `matchBase:true` in the options, and the pattern has no
slashes in it, then it will seek for any file anywhere in the tree
with a matching basename.  For example, `*.js` would match
`test/simple/basic.js`.

### Negation

The intent for negation would be for a pattern starting with `!` to
match everything that *doesn't* match the supplied pattern.  However,
the implementation is weird, and for the time being, this should be
avoided.  The behavior will change or be deprecated in version 5.

### Empty Sets

If no matching files are found, then an empty array is returned.  This
differs from the shell, where the pattern itself is returned.  For
example:

    $ echo a*s*d*f
    a*s*d*f
